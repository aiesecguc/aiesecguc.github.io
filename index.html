									<p class="twitter-post">It started as an ambition. I needed something to refill the colours of life. The journey to the land of mysteries promised me the chance to knit the threads of joy and satisfaction. I always wanted to go to such a place which can full fill my crave for adventure and thirst for creating a change which I always wanted to see in myself. AIESEC gave me this amazing opportunity to develop my leadership potential and clear the clouds of dilemma. Now I am more confident and have a clear vision regarding what I am and what I want to be. you want to go to exchange choose a country in which you never want to be born and live your fantasy that would give you the experience of your life .I feel proud that I made the right choice. I worked in a women rights project in Egypt in which I taught the age group of 12-18 year old about women rights. Along with this I also worked parallel on a documentary project .there were times things were hard still I generated that believe in me to overcome that fear of failure. This project helped me in knowing the conditions of women in Arabic countries and the problems they face in day to day life. Moreover I enhanced my interaction skills. Egypt as a country taught me how to be solution oriented in my toughest time. Everything seems to be a dream at first. Everyday going into the streets of an Arabic country with a contrasting culture wasn't an easy job but in the end I came to a simple conclusion that what you hear is not what you see. The people in Egypt are very humble and courteous with a much disciplined lifestyle. It's fascinating to see that how even after so much globalisation and upheavals a country is able to preserve its culture and inheritance .it's not easy to survive in a city with recent history of riots but this thrill gave me the experience I really wanted. There was time when a bomb blast 5km away was as fascinating as a firework show .I went for exploring Egypt but I end up exploring myself. Such is a beauty of this country. I really want to thank AIESEC in GUC. These 42 days which you gave me saved the next 42 years of my life.</p>

									<p class="twitter-post">If I have to describe Egypt in one world I would say, magic! Going there made me realise,  that without taking risks,  making experiences you cannot really discover who you really are, what you are really looking for in your life. Egypt and AIESEC in GUC showed me that no matter how far you are from home you cannot really feel alone, there always will be a second family for you,  doesn't matter where you go.</p>

									<p class="twitter-post">I remember the first question I had during my interview and my excited response about it…
-	WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM EGYPT? 
-	EVERYTHING. Even the bad times, I expect everything.  
I was not wrong at all. Egypt is still one of the best decisions I’ve ever made in my life. 

	My name is Tania, I’m 23 years old and I’m from Mexico. I chose Egypt, because I wanted my internship to be 100% different from what I have here in my country; once again, I was not wrong, from the language to the food and from the religion to the people, it was 100% different, and I loved that. I loved how everybody was willing to help; and yes, willing to sell as well (LOL), everybody was so warm to me that actually missing my country and my family was a feeling I could totally deal with, I felt like if I was already home. 
Besides having a new family I learnt how to be an EFFICENT independent woman, it helped me a lot with my patience and tolerance, and it helped in such a good way that I still feel that now, in my country, I’m better open-minded person.

	Falling in love with this country, their religion, their Sacred places, wouldn’t have been possible without AIESEC in GUC. I know every intern says this about their hosting committee, but I’m really sure, GUC was the best decision. It didn’t matter if “HE” was the president, or if “HE” was the team leader, they were all close to everyone, friendly and familiar and that’s what made it so awesome, making a new international family.
Amazing experience. Amazing people. Amazing Egypt. 

AMAZING AIESEC in GUC.
